assay_validation:
  description: How was the assay validated for specificity? e.g., in-silico, in-vitro,
    in-situ validations, sanger sequencing, repeat analysis with alternate assay,
    intra/inter species tests
  range: string
  annotations:
    section: PCR
    requirement_level: Recommended
    example: The assay was validated through a multi-step process, including in-silico
      analysis, in-vitro testing, in-situ trials, and final confirmation with Sanger
      sequencing.
