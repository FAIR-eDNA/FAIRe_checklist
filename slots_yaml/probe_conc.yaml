probe_conc:
  description: The stock concentration of the probe if applicable. This refers specifically
    to the concentration of the probe stock solution, not the final concentration
    in the PCR reaction. For example, using 1 µL of a 5 µM (stock concentration) probe
    in a 25 µL reaction results in a final concentration of 0.2 µM. Hence the entry
    for this term would be 5. Unit = µM
  range: float
