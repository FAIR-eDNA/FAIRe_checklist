pcr_primer_reverse:
  description: Reverse PCR primer (5' - 3') that were used to amplify the sequence
    of the targeted gene. The primer sequence should NOT contain MIDs and adapter
    sequences, and should be reported in uppercase letters. If multiple reverse primers
    are present in a single PCR reaction, either report them separately in separate
    submissions (with separate OTU tables for each primer set), or list the primers
    here separated by pipe ( | ) and provide one OTU table resulting from all the
    primers applied here. The latter is recommended only when the multiple primers
    target the same gene region and thus a single OTU table was generated from the
    multiplexed PCR. This term is required except for PCR free methods.
