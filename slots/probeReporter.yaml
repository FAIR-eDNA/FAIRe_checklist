probeReporter:
  description: Type of fluorophore (reporter) used. Probe anneals within amplified
    target DNA. Polymerase activity degrades the probe that has annealed to the template,
    and the probe releases the fluorophore from it and breaks the proximity to the
    quencher, thus allowing fluorescence of the fluorophore.
