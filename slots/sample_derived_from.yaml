sample_derived_from:
  description: This term refers to the samp_name of the original (or parent) sample
    from which the current sample was derived. For example, if sample "S01" (the parent
    sample) was collected at a sampling site and later subsampled into three child
    samples with samp_names "S01_1", "S01_2", "S01_3", then "S01" is the value for
    sample_derived_from in each of the child samples. This includes the case of pcr
    technical replicates.
