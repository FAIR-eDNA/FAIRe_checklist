assay_type:
  description: The method used in the eDNA study to detect taxon/taxa of interest
    in environmental sample. A targeted eDNA assay is designed to detect the presence
    of a specific species or a small subset of taxa (such as a genus or family) using
    techniques like quantitative PCR (qPCR). This contrasts with a metabarcoding eDNA
    assay which aims to characterize the composition of broader taxonomic communities,
    often encompassing multiple phyletic groups, by utilising high-throughput sequencing
    such as metabarcoding
