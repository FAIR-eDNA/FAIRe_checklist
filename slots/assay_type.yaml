name: assay_type
description: The method used in the eDNA study to detect taxon/taxa of interest in
  environmental sample. A targeted eDNA assay is designed to detect the presence of
  a specific species or a small subset of taxa (such as a genus or family) using techniques
  like quantitative PCR (qPCR). This contrasts with a metabarcoding eDNA assay which
  aims to characterize the composition of broader taxonomic communities, often encompassing
  multiple phyletic groups, by utilising high-throughput sequencing such as metabarcoding
