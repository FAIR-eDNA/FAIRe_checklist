name: maximumDepthInMeters
description: The greater depth of a range of depth (vertical distance below the local
  surface) at which a sample was collected. For sediment or soil samples depth is
  measured from sediment or soil surface, respectively. If there is only one single
  point of depth (no range), the values in minimumDepthInMeters and maximumDepthInMeters
  are the same. Unit = meter
