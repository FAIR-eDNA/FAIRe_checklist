name: minimumDepthInMeters
description: The lesser depth of a range of depth (vertical distance below the local

  measured from sediment or soil surface, respectively. If there is only one single
  point of depth (no range), the values in minimumDepthInMeters and maximumDepthInMeters
  are the same. Unit = meter
