minimumDepthInMeters:
  description: The lesser depth of a range of depth (vertical distance below the local
    surface) at which a sample was collected. For sediment or soil samples depth is
    measured from sediment or soil surface, respectively. If there is only one single
    point of depth (no range), the values in minimumDepthInMeters and maximumDepthInMeters
    are the same. Unit = meter
  range: float
