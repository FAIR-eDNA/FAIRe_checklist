name: quantificationCycle
description: The number of cycles required for the fluorescent signal to cross a given
  value threshold above the baseline for each technical replicate. Quantification
  cycle (Cq), threshold cycle (Ct), crossing point (Cp), and take-off point (TOP)
  refer to the same value from the real-time instrument. Use of quantification cycle
  (Cq), is preferable according to the RDML (Real-Time PCR Data Markup Language) data
  standard (http://www.rdml.org). Use "NA" (not zero) to indicate no amplification
  occurred. Unit = Cycle
