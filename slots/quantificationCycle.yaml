quantificationCycle:
  description: The number of cycles required for the fluorescent signal to cross a
    given value threshold above the baseline for each technical replicate. Quantification
    cycle (Cq), threshold cycle (Ct), crossing point (Cp), and take-off point (TOP)
    refer to the same value from the real-time instrument. Use of quantification cycle
    (Cq), is preferable according to the RDML (Real-Time PCR Data Markup Language)
    data standard (http://www.rdml.org). Use "NA" (not zero) to indicate no amplification
    occurred. Unit = Cycle
  range: float
  annotations:
    section: Targeted assay detection
    requirement_level: Mandatory
    unit: cycle
    example: '37.9450950622558'
