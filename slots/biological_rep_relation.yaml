name: biological_rep_relation
description: This term lists the samp_name of biological replicates associated with
  the current sample. For example, if three biological replicates ("S01_1", "S01_2",
  and "S01_3") were collected from the same sampling site, the value for biological_rep_relation
  in each of these replicates would be "S01_1 | S01_2 | S01_3".
