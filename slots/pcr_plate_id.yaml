name: pcr_plate_id
description: PCR plate ID. This identifier is particularly crucial when location-specific
  standard curves are employed for targeted assay detections, as it ensures a linkage
  between the standards and the corresponding eDNA samples. If two-step PCR was applied
  for a metabarcoding approach, enter the second PCR protocol under the term pcr2_*
  in the library preparation/sequencing section.
