name: stationed_sample_dur
description: Duration of on-site, stationed sampling (i.e., the filter deployment
  period). This term is recommended to be recorded when filters are deployed directly
  in the environment, such as during airborne eDNA sampling or when filters are submerged
  in water for a certain period). The duration should be recorded using ISO 8601 duration
  format (P<date>T<time>). For example, P1Y1M1DT1H1M1.1S represents 1 year, 1 month,
  1 day, 1 hour, 1 minute, 1 second, and 100 milliseconds
