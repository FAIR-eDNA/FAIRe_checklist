pcr_primer_conc_forward:
  description: The stock concentration of the forward PCR primer (pcr_primer_forward).
    This refers specifically to the concentration of the primer stock solution, not
    the final concentration in the PCR reaction. For example, using 1 µL of a 5 µM
    (stock concentration) primer in a 25 µL reaction results in a final concentration
    of 0.2 µM. Hence the entry for this term would be 5. Unit = µM
