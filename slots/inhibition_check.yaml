    example: The extracted DNA was tested using a serial dilution approach (undiluted,
      1:10, 1:100). qPCR was performed on each dilution to evaluate amplification
      efficiency and inhibition. The dillution with optimal performance with reduced
      inhibition was selected for subsequent analysis in the workflow.
