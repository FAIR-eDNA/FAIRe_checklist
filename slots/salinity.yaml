name: salinity
description: The total concentration of all dissolved salts in a liquid or solid sample.
  While salinity can be measured by a complete chemical analysis, this method is difficult
  and time consuming. More often, it is instead derived from the conductivity measurement.
  This is known as practical salinity. These derivations compare the specific conductance
  of the sample to a salinity standard such as seawater. Unit = practical salinity
