description: 'Temperature at which the prepared sample was stored prior to DNA extraction.
  Record either ''ambient'' or a numeric value in degree Celsius. Note: The storage
  temperature of the original environmental sample (e.g., water, soil) should be recorded
  under samp_store_temp, while the current term is for the "processed" sample such
  as filter paper, homogenised and subsampled sediment, prepared for DNA extraction.
  Unit = degree Celsius'
