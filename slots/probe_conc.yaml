name: probe_conc
description: "The stock concentration of the probe if applicable. This refers specifically\
  \ to the concentration of the probe stock solution, not the final concentration\
  \ in the PCR reaction. For example, using 1 \xB5L of a 5 \xB5M (stock concentration)\
  \ probe in a 25 \xB5L reaction results in a final concentration of 0.2 \xB5M. Hence\
  \ the entry for this term would be 5. Unit = \xB5M"
