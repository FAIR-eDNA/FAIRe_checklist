name: pcr_primer_conc_reverse
description: "The stock concentration of the reverse PCR primer (pcr_primer_reverse).\
  \ This refers specifically to the concentration of the primer stock solution, not\
  \ the final concentration in the PCR reaction. For example, using 1 \xB5L of a 5\
  \ \xB5M (stock concentration) primer in a 25 \xB5L reaction results in a final concentration\
  \ of 0.2 \xB5M. Hence the entry for this term would be 5. Unit = \xB5M"
