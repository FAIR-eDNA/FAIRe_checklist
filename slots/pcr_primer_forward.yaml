name: pcr_primer_forward
description: Forward PCR primer (5' - 3') that were used to amplify the sequence of
  the targeted gene. The primer sequence should NOT contain MIDs and adapter sequences,
  and should be reported in uppercase letters. If multiple forward primers are present
  in a single PCR reaction, either report them separately in separate submissions
  (with separate OTU tables for each primer set), or list the primers here separated
  by pipe ( | ) and provide one OTU table resulting from all the primers applied here.
  The latter is recommended only when the multiple primers target the same gene region
  and thus a single OTU table was generated from the multiplexed PCR. This term is
  required except for PCR free methods.
