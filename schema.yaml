annotations:
  glossary:
    Checklist: A list of eDNA metadata terms, that are mandatory, highly recommended,
      recommended or optional to fill
    (Data) term: A standardised field name used in data tables (e.g., column headers
      in sampleMetadata)
    MIDs: Multiplexing identifier tags to label DNA fragments originating from different
      samples, that are used to demultiplex the sequence data after sequencing
    Library: DNA amplified during the (library) preparation of a single sample. In
      other words, an amplicon with unique MIDs.
    Library pool: A pool of library that was loaded onto the sequencing platform for
      a sequencing run.
    Reference database: A collection of DNA sequences from known organisms, used for
      taxonomic identification of ASVs/OTUs
    ASV: Amplicon sequence variant. A unique sequence of DNA sequences recovered after
      the removal of erroneous sequences that were generated during PCR and sequencing.
    OTU: Operational taxonomic unit. A cluster of similar sequences that are grouped
      together based on a defined similarity threshold (e.g., 97%)
    Primer: A short single-stranded sequence of nucleotides that provides a starting
      point for DNA synthesis. Two primers (forward and reverse) are used in PCR.
    Assay: The complete set of reagents, protocols, and procedures used to perform
      the PCR amplification and to detect and measure the amplified product. It includes
      the primers, the DNA polymerase, the reaction buffer, dNTPs, and any additional
      components or steps required for the specific type of PCR being performed.
    Cq: The threshold cycle. The cycle number at which the fluorescence generated
      within a reaction exceeds the threshold level.
    Ct: The quantification cycle. Cq and Ct are synonymous terms.
