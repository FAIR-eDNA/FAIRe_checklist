    description: Forward PCR primer (5' - 3') that were used to amplify the sequence
      of the targeted gene. The primer sequence should NOT contain MIDs and adapter
      sequences, and should be reported in uppercase letters. If multiple forward
      primers are present in a single PCR reaction, either report them separately
      in separate submissions (with separate OTU tables for each primer set), or list
      the primers here separated by pipe ( | ) and provide one OTU table resulting
      from all the primers applied here. The latter is recommended only when the multiple
      primers target the same gene region and thus a single OTU table was generated
      from the multiplexed PCR. This term is required except for PCR free methods.
