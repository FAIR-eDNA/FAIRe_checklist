# FAIRe_checklist

This repository stores the current and previous versions of the FAIRe metadata checklist, along with a detailed version history. Recent updates include a draft model for migration to LinkML and programmatic generation of documentation. The starting point for the slots defined in `/slots` was `FAIRe_checklist_v1.0.2.xlsx`.

_In an effort to be transparent and controlled, we have created a programmatic workflow for incorporating revisions into the FAIRe checklist._

### Do not edit the following files by hand:
- The file `schema.yaml` is regenerated on each commit from the yaml files in `/slots`. 
- Two `.xlsx` files are generated from `schema.yaml`, beginning with v1.0.3 of the checklist.

---

### Latest Version

As described in #16, an issue was found with the excel generation scripts. v.1.02 has been restored as the correct excel files to download. v1.0.3 will be returned when the problem is fixed.
~~**v1.0.3**, released on 2025-07-31~~
