# FAIRe_checklist

This repository stores the current and previous versions of the FAIRe metadata checklist, along with a detailed version history. Recent updates include a draft for migration to LinkML. The starting point for the slots defined in `/slots` was this [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1htVmmXxm0y3teqIxpCSWKgVqfE3QyEC_/edit?gid=1681711496#gid=1681711496). The file `schema.yml` is regenerated on each commit from the yaml files in `/slots`. 

`schema.yaml` should not be edited by hand.
